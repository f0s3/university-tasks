# University tasks

This repo is created for saving all the work at university in one place to access it later and to develop some projects with ease.

## Structure

Root of the repo contains these folders:

 - semester1
 - semester2
 - semester3
 - semester4

Each of which contains folders, labeled with the variant of tasks in it.
For example: I am second variant, thus my work will be stored under folder named `2`.

Each variant has folder for every subject that has/had labs or any types of work that could be committed.
For example: I have subject called object-oriented programming and I am the second variant, thus my labs would be stored under `2/object_oriented_programming` folder.

## Other info

I tried to store as much as possible from every semester, so not only my variant is stored here.
I tried to collect my mates' works also.

**Note:** This is a WIP repo, files are added as the education process goes. Feel free to collaborate and create issues and PRs.
